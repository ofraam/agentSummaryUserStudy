				<p>
					TITLE OF RESEARCH: Summarizing agent behavior.

				</p>
				<p>
					PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: To examine different methods for effectively summarizing the behavior of a computer agent.
				</p>
				<p>
					WHAT YOU WILL DO: You will watch videos of different Pacman players and will be asked questions about those videos.
				</p>
				<p>
					TIME REQUIRED: Participation will take approximately 10-15 minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					RISKS: There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor for 15 minutes and using a mouse.
				</p>
				<p>
					COMPENSATION: Upon completion of this task, you will receive a code to enter on the Amazon Mechanical Turk task page, and you will receive the amount that was indicated on the task page.
				</p>
				<p>
					CONFIDENTIALITY: Your participation in this study will remain confidential. Your responses will be assigned a code number.
					You will NOT be asked to provide your name. You will be asked to provide your age and gender.
					Throughout the experiment, we may collect data such as browser type, operating system version, mouse movements, and error rates.
					The records of this study will be kept private.
					We will delete your Amazon Mechnical Turk Worker ID once we process your task and payment (within 3 days of completing this task).
					In any sort of report we make public we will not include any information that will make
					it possible to identify you without your explicit consent.
					Research records will be kept in a locked file; only the researchers will have access to the records.
				</p>
				<p>
					PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL: Your participation in this study is voluntarily, and you may withdraw and return the task to Amazon Mechanical Turk at any time. You will receive a compensation only if you complete the task. You may withdraw at any time by closing the web page of the task.

					Instructions - Pacman
				</h1>
				
				<div class="question">
					<p> In this task you will be shown pairs of video summaries of Pacman games. These videos will show you parts
						of games played by various Pacman players.
						<br>
						In the first rounds you will be shown two video summaries of <b>two different Pacman players</b>
						and will be asked to pick which Pacman player you would like to play on your behalf.
						You will earn a 10 cent bonus for each time you pick the Pacman agent that achieves a better
						score on average. You will be notified at the end of the task about the bonus you earned.
						<br>
						Later, you will be shown two video summaries of <b>the same Pacman player</b>. You will be asked
						to decide which video summary is more helpful for you in assessing the capabilities of each
						Pacman player.
					
					</p>
					
					<div class = question>
						<img src="images/startPacman.bmp" >
						Pacman's goal is to eat as many "pills" (white dots) as possible to earn points,
						while escaping the ghosts (ghosts are in the middle of the screen at the onset of the game as shown
						in the screenshot).
						<br>
						Pacman receives 10 points for each pill, and dies when its eaten by a ghost.
					</div>
					<div class = question>
						<img src="images/powerPills.bmp" >
						In addition to the regular pellets, there are also four special "power pills"
						(large white dots, shown in the yellow rectangles in the screenshots).
						Pacman receives 50 points for eating a power pellet.
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<img src="images/blueGhosts.png" >
						Eating a power pill also gives Pacman limited time during which the ghosts become blue (see screenshot)
						and Pacman can eat the ghosts. Pacman receives 200 points for each ghost it eats.
